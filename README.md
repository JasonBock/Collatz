# Collatz

This is a library that generates a sequence of `BigInteger` values, based on the [Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture). I'm primarly creating this package because I use this algorithm to demonstrate a number of development concepts in presentations, so having it as a NuGet package will make it a bit easier to reuse it.
